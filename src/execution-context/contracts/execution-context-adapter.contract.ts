 *
 * Adapter contract for managing execution context storage and lifecycle.
 *
 * This contract defines the contract for storing and retrieving context values
 * in different execution environments (e.g., AsyncLocalStorage for Node.js, thread-local storage).
 * It allows different adapters to implement context tracking differently based on the runtime.
 *
 * The adapter provides context isolation, ensuring each execution path has its own context:
 * - In async environments: context persists across await boundaries within the same execution chain
 * - In threaded environments: context is thread-local, preventing cross-thread interference
 * - In browser environments: context persists within the same call stack
 *
 * Common use cases:
 * - Audit logging: track request ID across nested function calls
 * - User identification: access current user without passing as parameter
 * - Per-request configuration: tenant ID, feature flags, localization
 *
 * @template TValue - The type of the context value being stored
 *
 * @group Contracts

     * When the function completes, the previous context (if any) is restored.
     *
     * Useful for:
     * - Maintaining context across async boundaries
     * - Isolating context between concurrent executions
     * - Implementing per-request or per-task metadata propagation
